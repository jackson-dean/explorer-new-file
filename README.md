# Explorer New File

Adds the missing keyboard shortcut for creating a new file in the file explorer.
Also provides a quick help menu for displaying other common explorer operations.

## Features

Pressing `cmd+n` while the explorer is focused will create a named new file inline
instead of opening a new untitled file window.

Press `?` to display a help menu for some other common operations:
- Create a new file
- Delete the currently highlighted file
- Open or expand the currently highlighted file or folder
- Open the currently highlighted file to the side
